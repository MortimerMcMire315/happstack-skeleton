# happstack-skeleton

This is a barebones Happstack project that provides well-structured scaffolding for the following:
  * Route handling
  * properly serving static files with MIME types
  * HTML/JS/CSS templating via Shakespearean templates
  * SCSS compiled into CSS at build

I figured it would just be nice to have around.
